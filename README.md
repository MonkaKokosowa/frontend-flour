# Floury Frontend
## ðŸš§ This project is still a heavy WIP ðŸš§
This is the main frontend of my website [that's here](https://wheatflour.pl). 
It uses Astro and WebTUI CSS Library. 

## Usage
You can use this docker-compose to run it, or just build from source and run on bare metal
```
version: '3'

services:
  wheatflour:
    image: ghcr.io/monkakokosowa/frontend-flour:main
    ports:
      - "4321:80"
```
It doesn't currently use .env so heads-up remember to change backend URL!


### Issues
If you find any bugs, please don't abuse them but just make a bug report at [the issues tab](https://github.com/MonkaKokosowa/backend-flour/issues). 
There's not much to abuse anyways, it's just me here :p
