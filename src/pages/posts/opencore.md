# So first things first
I am not good at hackintoshing. It's not my first time, but I never actually got it working by *just* following the guide (it's a good guide tho). This time I decided to use [OpenCore-Simplify](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify), I hate using generator and stuff as much as the next guy, but I really treated this as only a test, since all of the ones I've seen until now never actually did anything with ACPI. The generation itself went without issues (obviously though that's because the used PC I got has proper specs, even the GK107 core GPU without VRAM leakage issues). Anyway down below you got some specs
